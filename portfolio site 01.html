 					<p id="work-detail">NAILING is an app made for girls who love beauty and colorful life style. Users could simply create a unique pattern through three steps. It's a way that helps change people's mood and delight themselves.</p>
 					<p id="work-detail">In order to get user's current mood, I did some research with the help of psychology friends. We used Likert Scale as the principle of interaction design for color choice.</p>
 					<p id="work-detail">For the choosing part, colors are classified into two levels: hue and saturability. Users could simply choose the color that represents their current mood.</p>

 					<p id="work-detail">Drinking tea is one of my grandpa's favourite during his spare time, but I was lack of passion for a long time until one day I heard of a song from my favourite pop star, Jay Chou. The song was about an ancient scholar who wrote the first book of Chinese tea, and suddenly I got interested in the tea culture.</p>
 					<p id="work-detail">According to research and interviews, I found that only a few of the youngs know about Chinese tea. But almost no one knows exactly about the classification, history, drinking methods or taste of different kind of tea. What I wanted was to make people interested in tea culture and spread some less popular knowledge of Chinese tea to my users.</p>
 					<p id="work-detail">This project was my first try about packaging and product design, I put elements of tea and mountain together to show the beauty of nature and the charm of old culture.</p>

 					<p id="work-duration">June 2016 - October 2016</p>
 					<p id="work-detail">Earlier in 1980s, a crisis of abducting people occurred in China, in which most victims are kids. According to the research, there are 100~200 children being abducted in America, while the number in China is 70,000 every year.</p>
 					<p id="work-detail">It may be hard to imagine, but some human traders in China do use the kid they abducted as a begging tool. These children may be abused and even tortured to disabled only in order to make more money for the traders.</p>
 					<p id="work-detail">I'm always seeking for a way that helps find the lost kid through powerful social network. From a class at college, I learned about the facial recognizing algorithm and I suddenly realized it was the solution. Bring Them Home is an app&website concept design for parents who lost their kids and passers-by who are willing to help find the missing kids. After parents post the photo of their kids, the system will automatically build a personal file of his facial data. When a passer-by uploads a photo with a suspected missing kid on, the system could recognize similar faces and inform the uploader as well as parents.</p>

 					<p id="work-detail">My passion of travelling came from my grandma, who is 72 years old now and still keeps going out for fun every year. She insists using pens to write down her feelings about every places on an old notebook, which is also called bullet journal nowadays. However, most photos we take are in electronic devices and it is a huge problem to print them out and make them together with travel note. So I designed this multi-device application for travelers to make all kinds of electronic travel notes online, with which they can put photos, videos, audios, sketches and texts together easily.</p>
